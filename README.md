# LeveHelper

**LeveHelper** is a small plugin that lists all Levequests, so you can easily keep track of which ones you haven't completed yet.

You will not find this plugin in the official plugin repository.  
However, you're free to add my custom repository to get updates whenever I release a new version:  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Haselnussbomber/MyDalamudPlugins/main/repo.json

Open with `/levehelper` or just `/lh`.
