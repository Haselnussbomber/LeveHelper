# LeveHelper

**LeveHelper** is a small plugin that helps you keep track of your Levequests.

You will not find this plugin in the official plugin repository.  
However, you're free to add my custom repository to get updates whenever I release a new version:  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Haselnussbomber/MyDalamudPlugins/main/repo.json

Open with `/levehelper` or just `/lh`.

## Levequests

This tab displays a filterable Levequests table.

## Notifications

When a treasure chest or wanted target is found during a battle leve, the plugin will print a notification in the chat with a flag link to its location. These can be turned off in the configuration.
